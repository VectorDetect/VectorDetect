## Domain 2: Incident Response, Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

Key concepts:
- Incident Response = containment and recovery process when an attack occurs
- Business Continuity = keeping operations alive during crisis
- Disaster Recovery = restoring systems after major disruption
- Importance of predefined playbooks, logging, backups, RTO/RPO definitions

This domain sets the operational backbone for handling real-world cyber events. Without structure, everything fails under pressure. Itâ€™s what separates reactive chaos from professional handling.
