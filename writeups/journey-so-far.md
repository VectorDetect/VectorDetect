# Journey So Far

## Context
The last few months have been about rebuilding focus. I moved from scattered energy into a clearer plan: build skill in cybersecurity, mainly blue team and SOC analysis. I’ve started putting structure around the process instead of just watching videos or reading random material.

I now treat this like a system: input, process, output.  
Input is what I study (TryHackMe, CyberDefenders, YouTube deep dives, write-ups).  
Process is how I apply it (lab work, documentation, structured notes).  
Output is what I publish here (evidence of skill, learning trace, and proof of thought process).

## Milestones
- Created this repository **VectorDetect** to centralize everything: labs, write-ups, playbooks, and home-lab design.  
- Built initial structure: `/labs`, `/writeups`, `/home-lab`, `/playbooks`.  
- Learned the fundamentals of GitHub, Markdown, and basic repo organization.  
- Explored platforms like TryHackMe and CyberDefenders and identified what aligns best with my analytical style.  
- Started understanding what blue-team operations actually look like inside a SOC and how AI fits into that picture.

## Insights
The main realization so far is that cybersecurity isn’t about memorizing tools. It’s about **pattern recognition** and **constraint interrogation** — reading systems, understanding their limits, and identifying where those limits are breached. That’s what fits my cognition best.

The learning path isn’t linear. Some days it’s labs, other days it’s threat modelling theory or SOC workflows. The key shift has been from “learning everything” to **building demonstrable artefacts** that show capability.

## Next Phase
- Start real write-ups of completed labs with structured takeaways.  
- Expand the home-lab into something usable for detection testing.  
- Build the first few playbooks from common alert types.  
- Keep documenting every major insight or technical breakthrough here.

## Reflection
Five months ago I was scattered. Five months from now I’ll have a public trail showing consistent technical growth and system-level thinking. That’s the trajectory — from noise to precision.

*This repo is the first proof of direction.*
