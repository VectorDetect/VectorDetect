# Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) – Official Certification

## Overview  
This milestone marks formal completion of the **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** certification.  
After months of structured study, domain writeups, and disciplined practice, I’ve now moved from foundational learning to verified professional certification.

## Process  
Each CC domain was studied, summarized, and documented in detail within this repository.  
Those writeups reflect more than exam preparation—they represent comprehension of the operational mindset required to detect, protect, and sustain secure systems.

The process reinforced:
- Governance, risk, and compliance fundamentals  
- Security operations and incident response  
- Network and access control principles  
- Data security and lifecycle management  
- Foundational understanding of cryptography, system hardening, and risk mitigation

## Reflection  
This certification isn’t an endpoint but an operational baseline.  
It validates entry into cybersecurity from a defensive mindset—exactly aligned with my ongoing path toward SOC analysis and eventual threat modeling.

Holding the CC credential demonstrates verified adherence to the **(ISC)² Code of Ethics** and confirms readiness for professional environments handling real-world security posture.

Next phase:  
- Build practical SOC-style detections through a home lab  
- Begin preparation for **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)**  
- Progress toward Tier 1 analyst competency and documentation of live detections
