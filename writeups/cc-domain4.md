# CC Domain 4: Network Security

## Key Concepts

- **Network Topologies** – understanding how devices are physically and logically arranged (LANs, WANs, and wireless networks).
- **Secure Network Design** – use of segmentation, DMZs, and VLANs to isolate sensitive systems and reduce attack surfaces.
- **Network Access Control (NAC)** – enforcing which devices can connect to the corporate network or guest network using authentication and compliance checks.
- **Firewalls and Proxies** – controlling inbound and outbound traffic through rule-based filtering and content inspection.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** – identifying and responding to malicious activity in real time.
- **Secure Communication Protocols** – ensuring confidentiality and integrity with HTTPS, SSH, TLS, and IPsec.
- **Network Monitoring and Logging** – continuous visibility using tools like SIEMs and packet capture utilities to detect anomalies and suspicious activity.
- **Wireless Security** – implementing WPA3, disabling WPS, and applying strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Common Attack Types** – understanding and mitigating DoS/DDoS, ARP poisoning, MAC flooding, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Why This Matters

Network security defines how data moves safely across connected systems.  
Without proper segmentation, access control, and secure protocols, an attacker only needs one weak point to move laterally and escalate privileges.  
This domain builds the foundation for detecting, analyzing, and preventing network-based attacks — a core function in any SOC environment.
