# VectorDetect

Documenting my journey into cybersecurity - hands-on labs, SOC-style investigations, and detection engineering.  

I use TryHackMe, CyberDefenders and home-lab work to learn and produce write-ups, detection rules, and triage playbooks.

## Structure
- `labs/` — capture lab work and screenshots (e.g. FakeBank).  
- `writeups/` — detailed investigations and detection rule examples.  
- `home-lab/` — notes & diagrams for my lab setup.  
- `playbooks/` — triage and detection playbooks I build.

## Goals
1. Build detectable, repeatable investigations.  
2. Publish clear write-ups that prove I can do SOC tasks.  
3. Land entry-level SOC/blue-team roles and progress to threat modelling.
