# VectorDetect

Documenting my journey into cybersecurity - hands-on labs, SOC-style investigations, and detection engineering.  

I'm developing a portfolio focused on cybersecurity defense, detection, and incident response. The repository documents certification progress, lab work, and analytical reports designed to demonstrate practical capability in blue team operations.

## My Approach

•	High openness drives curiosity toward unseen system behavior and complex interdependencies.

•	High conscientiousness sustains precision across investigative and analytical processes.

•	INTJ structure converts observation into frameworks and repeatable methods.

•	Recursive analysis mirrors the feedback-loop logic of modern threat detection, incident response, and AI-driven defense.

The goal is to build practical, evidence-based security intelligence — combining structured logic with adaptive problem solving.

I use TryHackMe, CyberDefenders and home-lab work to learn and produce write-ups, detection rules, and triage playbooks.

## Structure
- `labs/` — capture lab work and screenshots (e.g. FakeBank).  
- `writeups/` — detailed investigations and detection rule examples.  
- `home-lab/` — notes & diagrams for my lab setup.  
- `playbooks/` — triage and detection playbooks I build.

## Goals
1. Build detectable, repeatable investigations.  
2. Publish clear write-ups that prove I can do SOC tasks.  
3. Land entry-level SOC/blue-team roles and progress to threat modelling.
